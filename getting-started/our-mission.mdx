description: "Connecting traders across chains: The omnichain approach"
---

We are actively progressing towards becoming an omnichain infrastructure and liquidity layer for DeFi, with the vision of unifying liquidity across all blockchains in a single orderbook. 

Orderly Network is not content with just revolutionizing trading infrastructure. We aim to create a truly interconnected trading ecosystem that spans across multiple blockchains, connecting traders from all corners of the decentralized world. 

Our omnichain approach will enable users to trade assets on different chains without worrying about the technical details of cross-chain swaps. By integrating with multiple chains, we will offer our users access to a wider range of assets and improved liquidity, creating a more vibrant and dynamic trading experience.
