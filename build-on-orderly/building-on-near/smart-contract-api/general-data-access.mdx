Given the off-chain/on-chain architecture, when users withdraw their funds, the smart contract checks the off-chain matching engine for pending orders to prevent double-spending. Orderly has implemented a fallback mechanism in case communication is lost between the two modules for a certain amount of time which can be checked using the following API:

## Get the Manual Withdrawal Time

`get_max_operator_downtime_nanos`

Parameters:

`none`

Queries the maximum duration of the downtime after which manual withdrawal will be available

## Get the Time Remaining for Manual Withdrawal

`get_withdraw_unlock_duration_nanos`

Parameters:

`none`

Computes duration after which manual withdrawal will be available
