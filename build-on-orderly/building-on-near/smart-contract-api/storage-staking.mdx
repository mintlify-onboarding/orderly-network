## Storage Deposit

`storage_deposit`

Parameters:

```css
args: {
    account_id: "NEAR account" //optional
    registration_only: "bool"  //optional
}
```

Registers an account in the smart contract/Deposit storage fee\*

\*_It cannot be used without any deposit attached_

This API creates a NEAR account\_id in the Orderly contract or is used to top up storage deposit and is a payable method, thus requires a specified amount of NEAR to be attached when first registering an account. The required amount can be retrieved using `storage_balance_bounds`. 

If `registration_only`\=`true`only the minimum required NEAR amount to register an account is accepted which can be retrieved using `storage_balance_bounds`. This cannot be true if the account already exists.

If the account already exists or the value of `registration_only`\=`false,`it can also be omitted.

<Note>
Any data stored in the contract, such as setting Access/Trading keys, token balance, etc., requires storage staking as per [NEAR architecture](https://docs.near.org/concepts/storage/storage-staking)
