Our interfaces require two keys to access, Orderly Key Pair (`ed25519`) and Trading Key Pair (`secp256k1`). Orderly Access Key Pair is generated by the wallet and more information can be found [here](/concepts/basics/accounts/access-keys) and instructions on how to create the keys can be found [here](/build-on-orderly/tutorial#generating-access-keys). Trading keys can either be retrieved from a GUI or generated on your own.

<Note>
    It is recommended to use function call keys rather than full access keys for safety

## Storage Deposit

`storage_deposit`

Parameters:

```css
args: {
    account_id: "NEAR account ID" //optional
    registration_only: "bool" //optional
}
```

Registers an account in the smart contract/Deposit storage fee\*

\*_It cannot be used without any deposit attached_

This API creates a NEAR account\_id in the Orderly contract or is used to top up storage deposit and is a payable method, thus requires a specified amount of NEAR to be attached when first registering an account. The required amount can be retrieved using `storage_balance_bounds`. 

If `registration_only`\=`true`only the minimum required NEAR amount to register an account is accepted which can be retrieved using `storage_balance_bounds`. This cannot be true if the account already exists.

If the account already exists or the value of `registration_only`\=`false,`it can also be omitted.

<Note>
    Any data stored in the contract, such as setting Access/Trading keys, token balance, etc., requires storage staking as per [NEAR architecture](https://docs.near.org/concepts/storage/storage-staking)
</Note>

## Set Orderly Key

`user_announce_key`

Parameters:

```css
// Parameters are optional and are only for cross-contract calls
// The key that signs this transaction will be registered if public_key is null

args: {
     //optional and is only required for cross-contract calls
     public_key: "ed25519: Public Orderly Access key",
}
```

Setting Access Keys requires a storage deposit

Binds Orderly Access Keys to the smart contract

## Set Trading Key

`user_request_set_trading_key`

Parameters:

```css
args: {
    //optional and is only required for cross-contract calls
    //if empty, the key used to sign this transaction will be used
    public_key: "ed25519: Public Orderly Access key"
    key: normalizeTradingKey,
}
```

Creates and binds a userâ€™s trading key to a user's Orderly Key

<Note>
Trading keys are generated using [elliptic-curve cryptography](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elliptic) and normalized using the following format:

Step 1: Hex the public key

Step 2: Remove '04' if present

Step 3: Hash it using keccak256

Step 4: Covert the result into a hex string

Step 5: Pass base64 of the resulting string
</Note>

## Check if Orderly Key Set

`is_orderly_key_announced`

Parameters:

```css
args: {
    user: accountId,
    //optional and is only required for cross-contract calls
    orderly_key: orderlyKeyPair.getPublicKey().toString(),
}
```

## Check if Trading Key Set

`is_trading_key_set`

Parameters:

```css
args: {
    user: accountId,
    //optional and is only required for cross-contract calls
    orderly_key: orderlyKeyPair.getPublicKey().toString(), 
}
```

## Remove Access Key

`user_request_key_removal`

Parameters:

```css
args: {
     //optional and is only required for cross-contract calls
     public_key: "ed25519: Public Orderly Access key",
}
```
