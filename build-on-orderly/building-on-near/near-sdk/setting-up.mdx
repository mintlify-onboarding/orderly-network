## Typescript

The library is written fully in Typescript, so no additional type installation is needed.

## Usage

### Available Clients

`contractsApi` \- asset manager smart contract client;

`ftClient` \- fungible token smart contract client;

`restApi` \- REST API client.

## Initialization

To initialize these clients you will need the following:

`contractsApi` \- SDK configuration options

`ftClient` \- contract URL and SDK configuration options

`restApi` \- SDK configuration options

SDK configuration options is an object with the next properties:

`networkId` \- NEAR network id to which we want to connect when working with the SDK. Currently, Orderly contracts are deployed on `testnet` and `mainnet` (fungible token contract is deployed only on `testnet`).

<Note>
_**Note:**_ You can read about NEAR CLI [here](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli)
</Note>

If you want to change the NEAR configuration options for smart contract clients, pass them as the last parameter in their constructors.

## First steps

After instantiating the smart contract client, call the `connect` function.
<Note>
_**Note:**_ As all requests work with HTTP don't forget to fetch the user balance after each action like`orderCreate`
</Note>
```java
import { AuthClient } from 'orderly-sdk';

const authClient = new AuthClient({
  networkId: 'testnet',
  contractId: 'asset-manager.orderly.testnet'
});

// you can bind that to connection button
await authClient.connect()

const api = await authClient.restApi()
const contract = await authClient.contractsApi();
const ft = await authClient.ftClient();
```

You can also use public API as well without connection:

```java
import { AuthClient } from 'orderly-sdk';

const authClient = new AuthClient({
  networkId: 'testnet',
  contractId: 'asset-manager.orderly.testnet',
  debug: true
});

const pubClient = authClient.publicClient();
await pubClient.getAvailableSymbols()
```

`near-js-api` can be imported from SDK to avoid version conflicts

```java
import { AuthClient } from 'orderly-sdk';

const authClient = new AuthClient({
  networkId: 'testnet',
  contractId: 'asset-manager.orderly.testnet',
  debug: true
});

const nearApi = authClient.nearJsApi
```
