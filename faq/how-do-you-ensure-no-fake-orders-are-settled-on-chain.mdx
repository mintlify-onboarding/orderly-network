title: "How do you ensure no fake orders are settled on-chain?"
---

All orders coming into the Orderly off-chain matching engine are signed by users' private trading keys and are settled on-chain with those signatures. Public keys are stored on the contract and the signatures are verified thus validifying orders.

The above model ensures that even in the event operator gets compromised, no fake orders are executed and all user funds are safe.
