title: "Fee Structure"
---

Orderly will implement a tiered fee structure based on a 30-day volume (separately for Spot and Futures). The fee structure can also be retrieved with our REST API.

Fees are subject to change at any time.

Brokers also have the ability to set custom fees. Please [reach out](mailto:support@orderly.network) to us if you are looking to set custom fees for your platform.

## Spot Trading Fees

| Tier | 30-day Spot volume | Maker  | Taker  |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1    | $0-$500K           | 0.100% | 0.100% |
| 2    | $500K-$3M          | 0.080% | 0.090% |
| 3    | $3M-$10M           | 0.060% | 0.080% |
| 4    | $10M-$50M          | 0.040% | 0.070% |
| 5    | $50M-$100M         | 0.020% | 0.060% |
| 6    | Above $100M        | 0.000% | 0.050% |

Spot trading fees are deducted from the converted token (e.g. converting USDC to ETH will incur fees in ETH)

| 2    | $2.5m - $15M          | 0.036% | 0.075% |
| 3    | $15M-$50M             | 0.032% | 0.070% |
| 4    | $50M-$250M            | 0.020% | 0.060% |
