## Introduction

There will be many ways to trade on Orderly. The users have the option of trading through an API or one of the 3rd party UIs.

## Trading through an API

For advanced users, Orderly offers API trading. Initially, users will have to use a GUI to generate an API Trading Key. When generating a key, please make sure to save it as it will be needed to access APIs and it will not be stored in your storage. 

For information on how to generate the keys, refer to our [Smart Contract API page](/build-on-orderly/building-on-near/smart-contract-api).

After the keys are generated the trading APIs can be found [here](/build-on-orderly/building-on-near/off-chain-engine-api).

## Trading on a UI

Developers have the option of customizing UIs to their specific needs and users have the flexibility to choose their preferred platform. There are numerous DEXes built on top of Orderly with many more in development. To explore the ecosystem of DEXes, you can access the information on how to get started here:

The liquidity of Orderly is shared across all applications that are listed on the platform. Due to the liquidity being pooled in one place, this means that no matter which application you are trading on, users will be accessing the same pool and orderbook. 

While there is not an official Orderly DEX, there are many teams hosting graphical user interfaces (GUIs) on the Orderly infrastructure.

<Note>
In NEAR Protocol, users have to pay storage fees when a token is first deposited into a contract and since Orderly Asset Manager contract stores users' tokens, some of the expenses will be passed on to the users, to make sure we can provide the best product
