## Request Signature Example
Orderly Network uses the `ed25519` elliptic curve standard for request authentication. Here, we provide a simple example that shows you how to send a valid request to Orderly Network.

Assume the following information:

Hash your request parameters with orderly-secret. The hashing logic is as below:

If the request looks like (details on how to generate the order signature can be found above):

POST /v1/order

# Body json:
```json
{
  "symbol":"PERP_ETH_USDC",
  "order_type":"LIMIT",
  "order_price":1521.03,
  "order_quantity":2.11,
  "side":"BUY"
}
```
First, normalize the order content:

1. Take the `timestamp` of the request
2. Concatenate it with the **request method** and **request path**
3. If the request body is not empty, concatenate the request body JSON by stringifying the JSON body.

Normalize request content. The result content would look like following:

```
1649920583000POST/v1/order{"symbol": "SPOT_NEAR_USDC", "order_type": "LIMIT", "order_price": 15.23, "order_quantity": 23.11, "side": "BUY"}
Then use orderly-secret to generate a signature using the ed25519 algorithm, and encode the signature in base64 url format:
```

Put the signature in the request header as orderly-signature, timestamp as orderly-timestamp, and orderly key as orderly-key.

So the final request would look like this:

```json
POST /v1/order HTTP/1.1

Content-Type: application/json
orderly-account-id: 0xb336b4dc9f87302da656862ca142a8d454268ae61759bf25d986f863d8374cf1
orderly-key: ed25519:8tm7dnKYkSc3FzgPuJaw1wztr79eeZpN35nHW5pL5XhX
orderly-signature: Z8ZgTnmMcKdfQBW62bLNON2YtMpz9riPvw-V33J3aA7_5VjaKehkQD06iAiagIMxja59bqp9L8zTLGXtBkHCCA==
orderly-timestamp: 1649920583000

{
  "symbol":"PERP_ETH_USDC",
  "order_type":"LIMIT",
  "order_price":1521.03,
  "order_quantity":2.11,
  "side":"BUY"
}
```
## Security
There have three layer checker to check if a request is valid. Orderly server only accepts the request that passes all checkers. The checker contains the following:

### Request Timestamp checker:
The request would be considered expired and get rejected if the timestamp in `orderly-timestamp` header have 300+ seconds difference from the API server time.

### HMAC Parameter Signature:
The request must have a `orderly-signature` header that is generate from request parameters and signed with your Orderly secret key.

### Orderly Key Validity Check: 
The request must have an `orderly-key` header, and the `orderly-key` has to be added to the network via the Add Key functionality, matched with the account and is still valid (not expired yet).
